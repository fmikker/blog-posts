My name is Fredrik Mikker, and I simply need a place to write about stuff I do or whine about something.
I won't stick to any area or category, this is pretty much about everything that pops into my head, such as politics, forestry, Free and Opensource software and music.

Probably some notes about [Naemon](http://naemon.org) will show up along the way.
