This is the first post created with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a new static html generator I will use to create my blog.

I got tired of heavy CMS systems such as Wordpress, and wanted a simple tool that I can run and update with a regular text editor and git to have version handling and rollback functionality. I think this will serve me well on my trip exploring git and vim.

This is the first try on a simple CMS, I've also heard some good about [Grav](https://getgrav.org/), but I'll give jekyll a shot and see how that goes.
