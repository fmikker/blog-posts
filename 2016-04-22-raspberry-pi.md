I just configured a Raspberry PI to be used as a TOR-relay following the guide created by [DFRI](https://dfri.se), with the guide: [DFRIpi](https://github.com/DFRI/dfri-rpi-tor).  

As the software is being updated it's not recommended to use this guide right now, but I didn't know that before I started.
I'll put this on hold until further notice.

To be continued..
