Tonight, Roky Erickson plays 13'th floor elevators.

The gig was at the venue Trädgården in Gothenburg, and it was pretty decent, I've never
really listnened to 13'th Floor Elevators as a band, but more the solo stuff
that Roky wrote. 
But all and all it was a good gig that just got better and
better.  It started off pretty mellow with a lot of slow songs that made me
think of Creedence Clearwater Revival, but it developed to real rock 'n' roll,
with a touch of 60's/70's garage sound that was really furious! Roky seemed a
bit tired, but that's no suprise if you know a bit of his
[background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roky_Erickson).  
All and all it was a good gig, and they said goodbye with some songs from his solo career:

* Night of the vampire
* Two headed dog
* You gonna miss me baby

Probably one or two more, but I can't remember right now..

10-4
