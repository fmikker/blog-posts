The roadmaster that is responsible to keeping the roads in shape around my grandfathers house in [Älvdalen](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/61129066) has decided that they need additional space on the side of the road. They require 4 meters from the road on each side to be clear for road maintenance.
Since there are trees in the way in those 4 meters, it's fallen on me to take care of the removal of those trees I'm out scouting for a chainsaw since the old one that I found in my granfathers barn has seen better days.. The carbourator was packed with rust, and the sword and chain was missing too.

So, I need a replacement to do some work around the farm, nothing fancy - just to clear some trees around the house and along the roads that are in the way.

*Requirements:*

* Must be a Husqvarna or a Sthil to be able to get spare parts and service from the local dealer
* Powerful enough to handle trees up to 30-40 cm in diameter
* Gentle to the hands vibration-wise
* Light enough to handle branching without causing back pain
 
Not really sure what I'm supposed to look for, but I'm glad that I have found a [forum](www.skogsforum.sa) full of competent people that knows their way around the woods and machines.
I'll continue my investigation and update the post accordingly.

*Update:*

So I got myself a chainsaw this summer.
The local dealership had not that wide selection of saws that fit into my requirements, but I think I got a pretty sweet saw for my bucks anyway. I ended up with a  [Stihl MS-251](http://static.stihl.com/upload/assetmanager/modell_imagefilename/scaled/zoom/92b4b3bf878f455caa10758dbd5d71a1.jpg) that I think will fit my needs pretty well.
The first test of this saw became a tough one, cleaning up the roadside of a gravel road to a house where my grandpa lives because the company that maintains the road had some specifications that needed to be followed (as mentioned before).

Anyway, the saw got to dig in to sand and gravel covered trunks with of different kinds of trees, varying from 5cm Birches up to 50-60 cm pine trees, and it performed well, acutally better than I did I guess..

I got a lot of instructions and tips and tricks from my grandpa that has been working in the woods for the majority of his life, ranging from cutting down pines during the winter, and pulling them out with horse and sled, to float them down the water systems to the sawmills during the spring.
It's sufficient to say that he got some useful information stored up there that he gladly shares with me, and I'm just as happy as him for being able to do - and learn a lot of things about cutting down trees and forestry in general.

The total of those 2½ weeks that it took to clear up the roadside became:

* About 50 trees in total got cut down
* One replacement chain for the saw, didn't really got the hang of filing the first chain, so I guess It's learning money..
* This ended up in about 90 logs that went to the sawmill
<<<<<<< HEAD
* Those in turn got transformed to about 215 planks and some beams that will be used to refurbish the house with
* About 4m3sk in firewood. Now I just need to get the fireplace going.
